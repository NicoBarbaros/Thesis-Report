\section*{Conclusions}

There are other rehab systems out there that use motion capture, but they often require sensor gloves or other proprietary hardware that take a lot of training and supervision to use, or they depend on rigging an entire room with expensive cameras or placing lots of sensors on the body. Thanks to Leap Motion, Kyno doesn’t require any extra hardware, cameras, or body sensors, which keeps the price affordable,. That low price point is extremely important.

Kyno is working to remove all the major barriers to physical rehabilitation by making a system that is fun, simple to use, and affordable. Kyno demonstrates the potential of NUI to make technology simpler and more effective—and the ability of Leap Motion technology to help high tech meet essential human needs.
