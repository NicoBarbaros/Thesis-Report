\subsection{Short thesis description}
Entering the application, the user will be in a wide room where he will be provided with a menu of programmable 3d objects such as cubes and other 3d primitives. With the help of Leap Motion he will be able to take those objects and to create blocks where after a push of a button the object that was programmed will behave accordingly to the block that user created previously. The user will enhance his VR experience even more by wearing Oculus Rift. It is going to be written in C-sharp programming language using Unity Game Engine. Also for this I will need Oculus Rift SDK for VR and Leap Motion SDK for virtual hands.
